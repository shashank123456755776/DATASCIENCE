Object Oriented Programming Launguage
It Helps Us to improve the code reusability ,structured and clean code
Why we need OOP (in short)

Organization → keeps code clean, structured.

Reusability → classes can be reused anywhere.

Encapsulation → data + functions together (like a capsule).

Inheritance → reuse old class for new classes (e.g., Teacher inherits from Person).

Polymorphism → same method name, different behaviors.

Scalability → easier to maintain and extend big projects

Real-life analogy:

A class is like a Car blueprint.

Objects are actual cars made from it (BMW, Tesla, Maruti).

Without OOP, you’d write separate code for each car. With OOP, one blueprint handles all.

1..classes and Objects
2..Abstractions
3..Inheritance
4..Encapsulation
5..Polymorphism
Classes-class is blueprint or templates for craeting objects 
Objects--as examples --map ka use kar ke ghar banya--objects are actually instance of classes 

class=car blueprint
object =actual car jo banya hai class ka use kar ke mtlb class
